Since we have two years to go for the next season to air, I took this opportunity to predict the possible character deaths in season 8 of the show using Machine Learning

I have run Five-Fold cross validaiton 100 times and achieved an accuracy of 93%

PS: The 7% error is thanks to GRRM's surprise deaths :P
